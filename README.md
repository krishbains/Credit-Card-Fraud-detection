# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection Using Logistic Regression

Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Implemented as part of personal learning in machine learning and data science.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Exploratory data analysis

Project Details:
- Utilized a credit card dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values and under-sampling legitimate transactions.
- Trained a logistic regression model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
- Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy score on the test dataset.

Results:
Achieved an accuracy score of 94% on the test dataset. Identified key features contributing to fraudulent transactions.

Skills:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, CSV
